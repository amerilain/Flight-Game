# Flight-Game, Requirement Specification Document

## Group One: Amir Ghari, Aleksi Merilainen, Chad McClusky, Arina Vasileva

### Chapter 1
###### Introduction:

    This document describes the purpose and functionality of Group one's flight
    simulator game from the player’s perspective. In this document, we will describe
    what the user can do with the game and outline the game's goals and implementation.
    
    This document is written for two audiences: first, it is intended as a reference for our
    group to use during project implementation/futre impovements and second, it is for the 
    player to better understand the purpose of the game and how they can interact 
    with it.

    Here we explain the game's current state, the purpse of the game, how it works, how
    it's played, and how the game is expected to perfom.

### Chapter 2:
###### Current State

    In its current state, Alien Weather  is an interactive, web browser-based game which uses 
    Leaflet maps and OpenWeather API as external data sources and the course’s flight_game 
    relational database. 

    The front end is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the
    necessary browser functionality. 

    Game operation logic is implemented as a Python-based backend service that provides an API
    for the browser, handles JSON responses, utilizes the language’s object oriented 
    functionality and takes sustainable development practices into account

    Alien Weather is appropriate for all ages, has concrete goals and provides a clear and 
    enjoyable gaming experience.

### Chapter 4:

###### Functional requirements – what the user can do with the game and how they interact with it

    Alien Weather has been designed in order to be intuitive for the player. Indeed, after entering his/her name,
    the player will be faced with different information bars such as the game status which represents the
    co2-consumed and co2-budget, the weather at different airports, and lastly distinctive goals that the player needs 
    to achieve.

    To interact with the game in an optimized way, the player first needs to enter the continent where he/she wants to 
    travel, afterwards, airports of that specific continent will be shown on the map. According to the remaining goals 
    and the weather status of each airport which is accessible by clicking on the airport marks, the player will decide in
    which airport he/she wants to land.

    The major challenge of the game is to achieve the goals while not exceeding the co2 budget threshold which is 15000 kg.
    Otherwise, the game will be over and the player has to start from the beginning
