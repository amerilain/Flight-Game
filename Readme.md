# Flight-Game, Requirement Specification Document
## Group One: Amir Ghari, Aleksi Merilainen, Chad, Arina Vasileva

### Chapter 1
###### Introduction:
    This document describes the purpose and functionality of Group one's flight
    simulator game from the player’s perspective. In this document, we will describe
    what the user can do with the game and outline our implementation goals.
    
    This document is written for two audiences: first, it is intended as a reference for our
    group to use during project implementation and second, it is for the hypothetical
    player to better understand the purpose of the game and how they can interact with
    it.
